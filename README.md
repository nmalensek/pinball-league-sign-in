# pinball-league-sign-in

Program designed to replace paper sign-in sheet at pinball league nights. Currently, players sign in and then their names are randomly drawn out of a hat. This program streamlines the process by replacing the physical random draw with a computerized one, significantly reducing time spent on creating the groups each league night. 

Implemented in vanilla Javascript and HTML to be as low-effort as possible to use and install. To run, place both files in the same folder, then launch the .html file in your browser of choice. Usage could be simplified further by adding all of the scripts directly to the .html file.
